<a name="why"></a>
## ðŸ¤” Why AR-Webstore? 

  ### Problem ðŸ˜§
Traditional e-commerce platforms fail to deliver immersive product experiences, leaving customers uncertain about the look, fit, and functionality of items. This lack of visualization leads to higher return rates as products may not meet expectations.

  ### Solution ðŸ˜ƒ
AR-Webstore revolutionizes the shopping experience by seamlessly integrating augmented reality. Customers can visualize products in their own spaces and view virtual features clearly. This empowers informed decisions, reduces return rates, and enhances engagement, resulting in a more satisfying shopping journey.

<a id="current"></a>
## Current State of the Project
It provides a list of e-commerce products along with their 3D photorealistic models to try in a 360-degree viewer. You can also view those products in your own environment using augmented reality to check details like chairs, photo frames, and cars as if they were present in your room.
